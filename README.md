# Base Switch

![](https://github.com/vlmaier/base-switch/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

**Base Switch** is an application I have developed back in 2014. I had no Git experience yet,
so unfortunately the commit history is not available. However, you can look at the code I wrote as an
undergraduate. During my computer science studies, I often needed a basic converter to solve various
tasks. So I decided to create an application to do that for me.

**Base Switch** allows Android users to convert numbers into different bases (decimal, binary, octal
and hexadecimal).
